This is a sketch on how to make the loop for the evaluate()
function in class Player(object), written in psudo-code


if all card in are same suit:
    flush
    if cards are in rising order:
        straight flush
        if highest card is ace:
            royal flush
            
elif cards are in rising order:
    straight

elif three cards match:
    three of a kind
    if another card match the three:
        four of a kind
    
elif two cards match:
    pair
    if two other cards match:
        two pair
        if last card matches either pair
            house
      
else:
    high card
